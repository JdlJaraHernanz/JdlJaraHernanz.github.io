                            <p>
                                I have studied a bachelor degree on International Studies at Carlos III University of Madrid (UC3M) from 2020 until 2025. This bachelor is taught completely in English which is not common in this level of studies in Spain. Consequently, I have made extensive use of my first foreign language throughout the courses.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As well, this bachelor has touched on several different branches of social sciences like political science, economics and law. Mainly these subjects have been studied in their broad global approach, for instance, with comparative political science or international law courses. Still my studies have provided me a multidisciplinar lens when looking at different social, political and economic phenomena.

                            <p>
                                In the academic year 2023-2024, I did an Erasmus Exchange to Aix-Marseille Universit√© (AMU) in France in which I studied at the Faculty of Economics and Management (FEG). There I took courses on economics and politics of the SSP branch of studies, all of which were taught in French, my second foreign language.

                            <h2>English - C1+</h2>
                            <p>
                                I have studied English since elementary school, continuously using it in my day-to-day either in university or when going abroad. I have great ease in expressing myself in the language, to the point in which I consider myself an advanced / proficient user. My last certificate in the language, the IELTS, gave me an 8 out of 9, which is .5 short of being labeled a proficient user by their standards.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <h2>French - B2+</h2>
                            <p>
                                As my second language, I did not have as much time as I did with the English language. This combined with a rough start, I did not properly start speaking the language till I reached university. From then onwards, I have nurtured myself to learn and expand the foundations of the language, obtaining a B2 to be able to travel to France. Now I am working on obtaining a certificate that can truly show that I can be considered an advanced user.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                I must add that this is not the end for me when it comes to languages since I am looking forward to learning new languages, specially Asian languages considering how unique and different they are from the Indo-European morpho-synthatical structure. Hope this section keeps on expanding in the following years...

                            <p>
                                Besides all the field knowledge I have gained around international relations, I have also obtained other technical abilities which are a huge asset. I have always liked working with computers and I have always found it fun to work with, even if sometimes it can be a little bit of a headache. Still, I believe not many people in social sciences find it easy to work with different virtual environments, hence making me somewhat of an interesting profile that can accommodate and learn easily in this area. Experimenting and trying to learn something new in this area is exciting and a challenge which I am all for it. I am also considering learning other new languages on my own, for instance Python since I know is very versatile and used in analyzing and describing data. Among the different key technical abilities that I have garnered through the years, these include:

                                <li>Data management languages like R or Stata.</li>
                                <li>Markup languages like LaTeX</li>
                                <li>...And a little bit of front-end webdesign (HTML, CSS, JS)</li>
